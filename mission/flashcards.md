# Flashcards

## What are flashcards?

Flashcards are essentially small pieces of information split into two - a front and a back. The front will typically have a question or a fill-in-the-blank type exercise, while the back will have the corresponding answer.

## Why use flashcards?

Flashcards allow you to associate small questions with small answers. This is an effective learning and memorisation technique because:

- Instead of memorising answers, you also memorise the question that lead to to them.
- Flashcards are small and therefore easy to revise on a regular schedule.
- Flashcards can be sorted into fine-grained groups.

This might be hard to understand at first, so let's go through an example. Let's say that you want to learn chemistry for an upcoming test. How can flashcards help you?

1. Firstly, you should create flashcards continuously as you learn the content. 
    - If you're doing this from a textbook, website, or any PDF, Cardz can make flashcards for you in a single click and save them to your personal library.
2. Secondly, you should keep revising these flashcards regularly. For added studying efficiency, a tool like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) can help you use spaced repetition to your advantage.
    - Luckily, Cardz has streamlined integration with Anki for easy transfer of your cards.
