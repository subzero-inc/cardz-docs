# Cardz Security
**Keeping your personal information and authentication details safe is our top priority.**

## How we deal with authentication
In order to log you into Cardz services, we use an external authentication provider called Firebase, from Google Cloud. 

At no point during the login process can we access your password, even if you use the email sign-in function. Security emails, which are dispatched to your inbox from `security@cardz.tech`, are not viewable by Cardz staff.

The only information accessible to our services after the authentication flow has completed is your email, name and profile picture, which we use to customise our services. This information is stored in our database system, which is kept secure with industry-standard practices.

## Access of information by Cardz staff
At any time, Cardz staff can access information about a user, limited to their name, email, quota usage, and privileges (for example, if your user is entitled to access the Pro Library). We also have access to all flashcards created on the platform. This ensures that Cardz moderation services can continue effectively.
