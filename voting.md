# Voting

## How do I vote?
Press either the upvote or downvote button on any card. For more information and a demo, visit the [User Guide](https://app.cardz.srg.id.au/guide)

## How does the voting system work?
Every flashcard can be voted on in order to show more relevant flashcards to Cardz users. Each card starts off with zero votes and accumulates votes based on which voting button users press.

There is an upvote and downvote button on every flashcard. As is common on the Internet, the upvote button is represented with an up arrow and **in**crements the vote count by 1. The downvote button is represented with a down arrow and **de**crements the vote count by 1.

Here's some tips about voting:
- Voting does not use any quota, it can be done on any amount of cards.
- You cannot vote more than once, but you can change your vote. For example, you can make your +1 a -1, but you cannot go to +2.
- Downvoting a card does not remove it completely from visibility. It is always accessible. If you see content that is inappropriate and you believe should be removed, use the [reporting function](https://app.cardz.srg.id.au/docs/reporting).
- Voting is also available in your personal Card Gallery and carries over to the Pro Gallery. Since both galleries use the same cards, the vote count will persist. For example, if you are a free user and your flashcard gets 50 votes from Pro users, you will see the vote count in your personal Card Gallery.

## Why have a voting system?
Voting allows us to surface the most popular flashcards for every user. This means that everybody gets quality flashcards and flashcards of less quality are not as visible.
