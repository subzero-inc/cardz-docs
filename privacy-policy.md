# Cardz Privacy Policy

## Card creation

To power our service, we save every flashcard that you make, as well as the small bit of text that was highlighted to create that flashcard. That allows us to:

- Display similar flashcards
- Provide the Card Gallery for Pro Users
- Fund our services (e.g. - through the Pro plan)

As a condition of using Cardz, you agree to have your flashcard uploaded to the Card Gallery. Additionally, you agree to the collection of a small amount of metadata from the textbook 
that you generate the flashcard from being collected - measurements such as the filename of the textbook, etc. This is important for us to be able to track service abuse.

You cannot delete cards uploaded to the Card Gallery except by contacting support personnel. If you accidentally create a card that contains information that you do not want to
be exposed to general Cardz users, contact support to delete it. There is a grace period on some cards that prevents them from being immediately public after creation
to mitigate these scenarios.

## Analytics

We use Google Analytics in order to collect measurements on Cardz usage and make the service better for everyone.

## Account deletion

Contact Cardz Support if you would like to delete your account. Depending on the number of flashcards that you have created, account deletion could take a while,
but we will do our best to purge your data from our systems.

## Data export

We provide data export capabilities for all users. This service can be used by navigating to the Settings page and clicking `Export My Data`.
