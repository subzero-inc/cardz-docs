# Quota

## What is quota?
Cardz has a built-in quota system that limits and regulates some of the actions you can perform on your account. Quota is a numeric quantity that is measured in quota units.

## Why have a quota system?
Every time you generate a flashcard with Cardz's machine learning system, you consume computing power that costs a certain amount of money (the cost of the machine learning model). This is a resource that is limited by the quota system. Without this system, we would not be able to provide the same service that we do today.

## What actions consume QUs?
The following actions consume quota:
- Generating a flashcard with Cardz's machine learning system (1 unit)
- Adding a previously-generated flashcard to your collection (0.5 units)

## How can I increase my quota?

### Free methods of increasing quota
- Removing a previously-generated flashcard from your collection "refunds" you the quota used to add it. Therefore, removing a flashcard from your collection grants you 0.5 quota units.
- If you report a flashcard while not being the flashcard's creator and our review system approves it, either manually or through automatic review, we grant you 5 quota units.
    - **This in no way is endorsing the mass reporting of flashcards.** Under our Terms of Service, such an action is not allowed and could lead to your account being suspended (at which point you will lose all your quota).

### Cardz Pro
You can purchase Cardz Pro to increase your quota. This gives you 100 quota units per month, for the period of your subscription.

## How much quota do I have?
You can check your quota limit and usage by going to the [homepage](https://app.cardz.tech/). Free users start off with a quota of 100 units.
