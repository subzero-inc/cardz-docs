# The bookshelf
> **NOTE**: This feature is currently in closed beta preview. Users without specific authorization will not be able to access the bookshelf's features.

Cardz includes a bookshelf feature to let you store your textbooks across devices. It's simple: just upload a PDF, and you can open it in Cardz across any device where your account is signed in.

## In-depth tutorial
You can access the bookshelf via the 'Bookshelf' link in the menu bar. The left of the page contains some information about your bookshelf, and the right contains the books that are within it.

You can hover over any of the books in order to see options to open in Cardz, download and delete them.

The left of the screen simply contains an option to upload a book.

## Uploading a textbook
Uploading a textbook is easy:

1. Click 'Upload a book'.
2. Enter a name for the book, and click 'Next'.
3. Select the file and click 'Upload'.

Large textbooks may take some minutes to upload, while small ones (<30mb) will take much shorter.

Your textbooks are stored in a secure cloud storage service and only accessible with a private link.

When the textbook is uploaded, we process it and generate a cover. However, this process takes around thirty seconds. Therefore, you may temporarily see a placeholder image - it will be replaced with the actual textbook cover shortly.

## Book options

### Open in Cardz

This option will open the Cardz reader with the textbook that you've selected.

The reader will remember your previous page position for the book, if there is one, so there is no need to scroll all the way back to where you were.

Additionally, using the 'Open with Cardz' feature will allow every flashcard that you create on that open textbook to be linked back to your bookshelf, so you can easily find the connections between the textbook and the flashcards.

### Download

Pressing this button will download the PDF to your local device. This may be useful to transfer your textbook to multiple devices.

Note: your browser may open its inbuilt viewer to allow you to preview the textbook, but this will not have any flashcard technology.

### Delete

This will initiate a delete of the file within our servers as well as mark the book as being deleted.

Note that since every flashcard created in a textbook is linked back to that textbook, we will keep some information, such as the textbook name, cover image and upload date in order to preview.

For an example of how a link to a deleted textbook will look, see the following page: https://app.cardz.tech/bookshelf/fb11c167-65eb-496a-9caa-eeae2e50568d. 

Since we no longer store the textbook PDF on our servers, the file is no longer available.
