Here you can:
- Go to flashcard page - access the flashcard's individual page, where you'll also see similar flashcards from the same topic
- Filter by topic - you'll only see this in the Gallery views
- Print flashcard - you'll get a single sided A4 piece of paper that you can fold over. 
    - **Note: we support the printing of up to 400 flashcards at a time in a much more efficient way** - look for the blue button in gallery or deck pages.
- Create similar flashcard - this allows you to remix or 're-roll' the flashcard from the same original information. Note: this uses up one of your quota units, no matter who owns the original flashcard.
- Report this card - this button engages the [reporting flow](/docs/safety/reporting).
