# Getting started with Cardz
Hi there! We're glad you've decided to go on your AI-assisted learning journey and we're here to help you get started.

If you don't already know, Cardz is a service that helps your create flashcards from textbooks (and websites) with just one click or keyboard press.

Let's get started.

## 1. Open the PDF viewer

While you can use our browser extension to use Cardz from any website on the internet, we're just going to use a textbook for now.

Head over to the the <a href="/viewer.html" target="_blank">PDF viewer</a> and check out the layout.

The menu bar on the top right is especially important.

From left to right, the options are:

- Go home
- New flashcard from selection
- Presentation mode
- Open file
- Print
- Download this file
- View bookmarks
- Hide options (>>)

## 2. Open a PDF file

Click the 'open file' icon (the folder with an up arrow) and browse to a PDF that you have saved on your computer.

*Don't have any PDFs at the moment? Try [this PDF of a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/pdf/Human) for this tutorial.*

<!-- ## 3. Use like normal

The PDF viewer is Cardz is mostly identical to the one you might have installed on your computer. It's very likely that you'll be able to do the exact same things.

Play around with it for a little to get comfortable with controls. -->

## 3. Create a flashcard

Highlight a piece of text on the page by clicking and dragging. The text should be short (<400 characters) and should include a piece of information.

Below is an example text that you could highlight.

>The genus Homo evolved from Australopithecus. The earliest record of Homo is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and theearliest named species are Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis which evolved by 2.3 million years ago. The appearance of the genus coincides with theinvention of stone tool manufacturing

This includes pieces of information that are direct and is short enough to be accepted. 

Note that due to the nature of PDFs, some words are formatting incorrectly, such as "theinvention". This is usually okay because our AI model is capable of parsing out the mistakes.

After you've highlighted the piece of text, either press the create flashcard button (+) or <kbd>Control/Cmd+D</kbd>.

This will open up a new window or tab with a creation window.

## 4. Check out your new flashcard

After a few seconds, you should get a new flashcard with a front and a back, as well as similar flashcards in the same topic.
