# Decks

Decks are an extremely useful way of organizing your flashcards.

You can create decks out of as many cards as you like from as many topics. Decks are there to help you organise your cards and share them with others. If you are a Pro user, you can use cards from the pro library for decks as well, if not, you may onl use your own.

## How a deck looks

Once a deck is made, you can access it at `https://app.cardz.tech/d/<some deck id>`.

A deck looks like this:

A deck has a description ("Lots of cards about medicine!") and a **deck composition widget**, which helps you tell what topics are inside the deck.
