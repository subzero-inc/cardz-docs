# Product Improvement Roadmap (after YICTE Judge Review)

This is a log of how we want to improve our product after the review provided by the Young ICT Explorers judges on the 24th of November.

## Judge review overview
Only judges that included possible improvements that we could have made are in the below table (i.e, judges with only positive comments are not included).

| Judge | Comments | Our response |
| -- | -- | --|
| Darren Oliver (SensaWeb) | It would be useful to have a page addressing **why** flashcards are useful, as well as an overview of the architecture | We have released an [overview of the architecture](/docs/architecture). We are working on updating our branding and product flow to include messaging that promotes the use of flashcards for learning. |
| Geoff Leong (Infosys) | Consider trademark and copyright restrictions, especially in regards to uploading textbooks | The textbook upload feature is not yet released, and we will consider this before releasing (if we feel that copyright is too dicey, we will not release this feature at all). We will also develop documentation to inform users of possible copyright issues on their extracts |
| Vijayalakshmi Mohandoss (SAP) | A clearer user guide would have been better, as well as more information on security | We have now released [documentation on Security](/docs/security). We will work on a better user guide. |
| Viney Kumar (GSK) | Flashcard generation from entire book chapters or sections would be a useful extension of our product | This is a good idea. We will add it to our product roadmap and work on finding a way to do this. Possible considerations: more advanced textbook parsing (find chapters/sections), chunking of OpenAI requests? |
| Vinith Gopalakrishnan (Infosys) | Mechanisms to reward contributors should be implemented. Also, we should explore using this as a plugin for content creators or learning platforms | We had been looking into allows decks to be [embedded](https://app.cardz.tech/i/embed/deckchip/8aBOSApcErXj9V7tafkQ) as a small feature, but we may expand this and include messaging within the core product to advertise this as a bigger feature. As for compensation or rewards for contributors, this is a good idea and we will engage in more development and ideation and try to find a solution. |
